### About This Project
This is my own take on the classic Asteroids game, employing pure JavaScript initially. 

I have subsequently implemented Webpack for code minification, to help optimise the loading process for web browsers, before implementing TypeScript and going on to break the code up into modules.

### Playing The Game
You can play the game at [alchamyst.github.io/asteroids-js](https://alchamyst.github.io/asteroids-js/).
